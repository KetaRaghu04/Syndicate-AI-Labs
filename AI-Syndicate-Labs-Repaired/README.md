# AI Syndicate Index (ASI)

**AI Syndicate Labs** is building the first on-chain, quant-weighted index tracking the AI crypto economy â€” combining high-utility protocols and memetic narrative tokens into one composable token: `$ASI`.

## ðŸ“Š Why It Matters

AI is one of the most dominant narratives in Web3, yet exposure is fragmented. The ASI Index delivers structured exposure via a data-driven, smart-contract-governed index â€” just like the S&P 500, but for crypto AI.

## ðŸ§  Index Methodology

ASI uses a composite score based on:

| Metric             | Weight |
|--------------------|--------|
| Market Cap         | 30%    |
| Liquidity          | 25%    |
| Narrative Velocity | 25%    |
| Inverse Volatility | 20%    |

```python
Score = 0.30 * mcap + 0.25 * liquidity + 0.25 * narrative + 0.20 * (1 / volatility)
