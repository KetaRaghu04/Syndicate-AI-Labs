# ASI Index Governance Roadmap

## 🧱 Governance Vision
AI Syndicate Labs aims to evolve the ASI Index into a fully decentralized, community-governed protocol that transparently manages AI token exposure through on-chain rules, data-driven methodology, and verifiable governance.

---

## 🧑‍⚖️ Governance Phases

### Phase 0 – **Founder-Led** (Current)
- Index allocations and updates are performed manually by the founding team
- Allocation logic is transparent and tied to the published methodology

### Phase 1 – **Multi-Sig Governance**
- Introduce a 3-of-5 multisig treasury council to approve rebalance proposals
- Community contributors nominated to represent both quant and community sides

### Phase 2 – **Token-Governed DAO (vDAO)**
- Launch of **$SYN** (Syndicate Governance Token) – separate from $ASI
- $SYN holders can:
  - Propose asset additions/removals
  - Vote on rebalance frequency
  - Adjust scoring formula weights
  - Elect council members

> $SYN governs methodology. $ASI is the product.

## 🗳️ Governance Design Principles
- **Transparency**: All proposals, weights, and voting are public
- **Data-Driven**: No subjective decisions without justifying data
- **Dual-Track Voting**:
  - Quick votes (off-chain via Snapshot)
  - Binding changes (on-chain once DAO is live)

---

## 🏛️ Proposal Lifecycle
1. **Ideation** (Forum/X/Telegram)
2. **Formal Submission** (snapshot.ai)
3. **Discussion & Data Validation**
4. **Voting Period** (5 days)
5. **Execution** (manual or on-chain)

---

## 🧩 Future DAO Tools
- **Tally/Snapshot** integration
- **On-chain execution** via Gnosis Safe modules
- **Reputation-based weight modifiers** for long-term stakers
- Delegation layer for passive voters

---

## 🔐 Treasury Management
- Treasury governed by DAO
- Revenue from $ASI streaming fees sent to treasury
- Treasury used for audits, grants, R&D, and contributor incentives
