# Tokenomics â€“ $ASI & $SYN

The AI Syndicate ecosystem operates under a **dual-token model**:

- `$ASI` â€“ The index token
- `$SYN` â€“ The governance and utility token

Together, they enable exposure, rebalancing, voting, and composability in the AI index economy.

## ðŸ”¹ $ASI â€“ AI Index Token

The `$ASI` token represents a share in the ASI Index. It is backed by a dynamic, quant-weighted basket of AI-related cryptocurrencies, both utility and meme.

### Key Properties

| Property         | Value                                  |
|------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Token Standard   | ERC-20                                 |
| Backing          | On-chain vault of underlying assets    |
| Supply           | Elastic / Minted on demand             |
| Transferable     | Yes                                    |
| Composable       | Yes (DeFi, staking, LPs, etc.)         |

### Utilities

- Represents **exposure** to the full AI sector in crypto
- Tradable like any other ERC-20 asset
- Redeemable in future versions for vault shares
- Eligible for staking-based rewards (optional layer)
- Used in ecosystem integrations (e.g., lending, yield vaults)

## ðŸ”¸ $SYN â€“ Syndicate Governance Token

The `$SYN` token governs all decisions related to the ASI Index.

### Key Properties

| Property         | Value                                 |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Token Standard   | ERC-20                                |
| Max Supply       | 100,000,000                           |
| Distribution     | Community, contributors, stakers      |
| Vesting          | Team & advisor lockups (12â€“24 months) |

### Utilities

- **Governance voting**: inclusion/removal of tokens, rebalance rules, automation, fees
- DAO treasury control and proposal system
- Delegation support via Snapshot or on-chain DAO tools
- Governance mining rewards (for participating voters)
- Utility token for early-access features

## ðŸ”„ Distribution Breakdown

### $SYN Allocation

| Category           | Allocation (%) | Notes                              |
|--------------------|----------------|------------------------------------|
| Community & DAO    | 40%            | Airdrops, liquidity mining, grants |
| Contributors       | 20%            | Devs, researchers, partners        |
| Treasury Reserve   | 15%            | Future initiatives, emissions      |
| Strategic Partners | 10%            | VCs, DAOs, infra projects          |
| Team & Advisors    | 15%            | 12â€“24 month vesting                |

> Unused DAO funds may be reclaimed and burned via vote.

## ðŸ’± Revenue Streams

The ASI Protocol is designed to be **self-sustaining** through:

- **Streaming Fee** on $ASI holdings (e.g., 1% annually)
- **Performance Fee** on rebalanced gains (optional)
- **Vault Participation Fees** in future versions
- **Governance Fee**: $SYN holders receive share of revenue via staking

All fees are governed by the DAO and can be toggled on/off via proposals.

---

## ðŸ§® Example Token Flow

1. A user mints $ASI â†’ underlying assets are deposited into index vault
2. DAO rebalances weights via contract â†’ $ASI reflects new index composition
3. $SYN holders vote on rebalances, upgrades, or parameter changes
4. Fees are collected, optionally streamed to staked $SYN holders
5. Treasury is managed by DAO using $SYN proposals

---

## ðŸ§  Future Extensions

- Staked $ASI vaults earning real yield via AI-token lending
- Cross-chain ASI Index versions (Solana, Base, Arbitrum)
- $SYN as gas or staking token in third-party partner tools
- AI-based reweighting models for sentiment vs. fundamentals
- ASI ETF wrapper for TradFi exposure (via tokenized securities)

## ðŸ’¡ Summary

| Token | Function        | Utility                          |
|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------|
| $ASI  | Index Exposure   | Tracks top AI assets on-chain     |
| $SYN  | Governance Power | Controls the rules of the index   |

> Together, they bring structured intelligence and real composability to crypto-AI investing.
